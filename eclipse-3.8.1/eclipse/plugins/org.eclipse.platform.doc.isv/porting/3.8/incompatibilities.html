<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.7 and 3.8</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.7 and 3.8 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.7 plug-ins to 3.8. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.7 plug-in on 3.8.

<h2>1. <a name="concurrent">Bundle org.eclipse.equinox.concurrent no longer in Platform feature</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong>Any bundle or feature that requires or includes 
the bundle <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.concurrent</tt>.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>This bundle was never explicitly included in the Eclipse
platform, but was installed due to an optional dependency from one of the platform's bundles.
Due to a change in how optional dependencies are treated at install-time, this bundle
is no longer included in the Eclipse platform. The bundle is still included in the Equinox SDK,
and is included in both the Eclipse project and Juno release train central repositories.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients with a feature depending on
but not directly including the bundle <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.concurrent</tt>
will need to add a direct dependency if they need it.
</p>

<h2>2. <a name="osgiconsole">Equinox OSGi console no longer built into the Equinox Framework</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong>Any product or launch configuration that supports the 
Equinox -console command line option.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The new Equinox console shell is based on Apache Felix Gogo shell and provides features
upon it. It is decoupled from the framework itself.  The built-in OSGi console
provided by the Equinox framework (org.eclipse.osgi) is disabled by default.  The
new Equinox console is now provided by bundles which must be installed in order
to support the -console option.  The new console supports completely and 
transparently the traditional Equinox-style commands, and also supports the 
new Gogo-style commands. It also provides telnet and ssh connectivity.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong>
In order to use Equinox with the new shell, it is necessary to install along with
the framework also the console bundle itself - org.eclipse.equinox.console and
the three Gogo bundles - org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime,
org.apache.felix.gogo.command, org.apache.felix.gogo.shell.
A detailed documentation for the new Equinox console is available at
<a href="../../guide/console_shell.htm"><b>Console Shell</b></a>.
The old built-in Equinox OSGi console shell may be enabled by specifying
the following configuration property:
<pre>  osgi.console.enable.builtin=true</pre>
</p>
